      <p class="pg2_cnt1">In the age of rapid technology growth, developments in adhesives, sealants, encapsulants, paints & specialty coating materials are taking place all over the world to suit diversified challenging applications.  In order to cope up with the advancement, Anabond Ltd has established an in-house research and development centre in the year of 1979.  This research and development centre is capable of handling multidisciplinary activities. </p>
      <p class="pg2_cnt1">Anabond’s ultimate vision is to become a technology originated, globally competitive company with strong support of in-house R & D.  Anabond’s R & D centre has been approved by Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, Ministry of Science & Technology, Government of India, New Delhi.</p>
      <p class="pg2_cnt1">This R & D centre was founded by Mr. J. Vijayakumar.  This centre is presently headed by Mr. K. Adhinarayanan, who has an experience of 37 years in the field of adhesives & sealants.  Under him there are 23 dedicated scientists, 12 chemists and 8 supporting staff working towards developing various grades of adhesives, sealants, encapsulants, paints & speciality coating materials based on different types of polymeric systems such as epoxies, polyurethanes, silicones, acrylics, synthetic elastomers etc.
 </p>
      <p class="pg2_cnt1">This R & D centre is housed separately in a floor area of 12,500 sq.ft.   This R & D centre is fully equipped with latest testing equipments, which are required to test the various physical, mechanical and electrical properties of adhesives and sealants and related products developed in-house.  A full fledged analytical facility is also available in the R & D centre to characterize the raw materials and also the intermediates developed in-house. Though the chemistries involved in the area of adhesives and sealants are very vast, Anabond’s R & D centre is actively involved in the development of products based on the following chemistries for specific end applications.
